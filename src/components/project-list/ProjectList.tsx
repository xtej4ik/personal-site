          NC News - Back End is a straightforward web API that enables users to
          read, post, and comment on news articles. It was developed to
          complement the nc-news Front End project. This project was created as
          part of the Northcoders web development bootcamp, serving as a
          portfolio piece to showcase proficiency in full stack development
          using Node.js and React.
